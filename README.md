# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Henri

## About Me

Passionate about working smarter, not harder, coding has become a passion for me. Continuously looking to improve, my focus is mainly on software design and testing. I believe in iterative development and the importance of automated pipelines for assuring fnctionality, quality and security properties.

â™¥ I love whiteboards, refactoring code and inner-sourcing accross teams.

ðŸ”¨ A tool you may not know but worth checking out: [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) for storing architectural diagrams and decision within version control!

## Techonologies I like using and where

### Java for backend software and cross-platform applications

- Frontend for P2P forum application built in Go listed above with fully asynchronous comunication with the backend for high availability (ReactJS)

### NodeJS for scripting
